This script can be used on Google accounts to email daily agendas in plain text to your Evernote account.

I like the idea of using Evernote as my "external brain".  I often found myself trying to remember a meeting or a person's name that I had interacted with, but could not easily recall.  Searching a Gmail calendar on an iPhone is not easy, but searching Evernote (even offline) is.  This script will send an email daily with your agenda.  It has a date in the title of the note that it adds and is easily configurable to automatically add to a particular Notebook.  In this case, it is configured to add each note to the "CalendarAgendas" Notebook.  The body of the note will contain each event in a nice, readable format with each attendee's email address.  Because Google Apps Script is a little finickey in dealing with names, I chose to only add email addresses, which for the most part, gives me the functionality I need.
